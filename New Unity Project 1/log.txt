Terrain too big

AI bouncing around...

Was having problems using the built-in ThirdPartyController for animations, so made my own Animator with a state machine representing the transitions. The Controller now gives its speed to the animator which changes animator depending on idle/walking/running. Added bonus is this works with the AI too! 

Addressed issues with AI bouncing by preventing the AI script from changing its y position. This meant I could then use the RigidBody properly and the AI now obeys gravity. In addition, stopped AI running into the player for now.

- Should have AI patrol in a circle around the pickups, and chase the player when they get near them.

Added obstacles and code to the character controller to allow the user to push them.
